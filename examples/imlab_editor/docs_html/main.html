<h2><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p><b>ImLab </b>is a free open source graphical application for Scientific Image Processing that runs in Windows, 
  Linux and many other UNIX systems. It supports multiple windows, data types including 32 bit integers, 32 bit real 
  numbers and complex numbers. It is implemented in C++ and C to provide a very simple way to add new functions. 
  It has many image operations and supports several file formats.</p>
<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This program has been created to serve as a laboratory to implement routines of 
Image Processing for the <strong>IM</strong> toolkit. 
<b>ImLab </b>was 
  build using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup">IUP</a> (interface),
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/cd">CD</a> (drawing) and
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im">IM</a> (imaging) libraries. It runs in Windows, Linux, SGI 
  IRIX, SunOS, IBM AIX and MacOS X (using X-Windows).</p>
<p>The Tecgraf libraries and <b>ImLab </b>are free for academic and commercial use. See the 
<a href="copyright.html">copyright</a> 
  note of <b>ImLab</b>. </p>
	<p><strong>ImLab</strong> is registered at the National Institute of 
	Intellectual Property in Brazil (INPI) under the code BR 51 2016 001656-6, 
	and so it is protected against illegal use. The registration is valid 
	internationally.</p>
<p>Its interface is very simple that means it still does not have direct image manipulation. However, it can be 
  extended for that purpose.</p>
<p>It does not have a generic plug-in extension mechanism, but creating new functions in the &quot;<i>Process</i>&quot; menu is 
  quite simple and very similar to a plug-in. </p>
<p><b>ImLab </b>is implemented in C and C++, but aiming simplicity I did not use complex classes to model images and 
  other objects. I do use some C++ templates to implement processing routines for 
  the available data types, the code is rather simple to understand, even for those who do not know this mechanism.</p>
<p>In several situations <b>ImLab </b>can be the ideal program to develop new Image Processing algorithms, articles, 
  thesis and dissertations.&nbsp; If you are interested in using <b>ImLab </b>download the source code and/or the 
  executable. If you find it useful and would like to contribute, forward your work in 
<b>ImLab </b>to me and I will 
  include it in the next distribution. And I hope to be able to help so as to make this feasible.</p>
<p><span class="style2">Support</span> is provided whenever I can, usually during my free time and weekends. I 
recommend using the mailing list, 
  you do not have to subscribe to send a message and mail is moderated, so to subscribe is a good idea 
so you can receive 
  update notifications. This is a very low traffic list. The list is hosted in a
  <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/imlab-users">SourceForge List</a>.</p>
<p>See some screen captures of the program in <a href="screenshots.html">Screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>See the list of <b>ImLab </b><a href="features.html">Features</a>. Most of them are inherited from the IM library.</p>
<p>Some algorithm implementation was derived from 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/~blab/Software/Xite/">XITE</a>, here is their respective

<h2><a name="history">Origins</a></h2>
<p>My first important Image Processing System was
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~scuri/spid13">SPID</a> in 1993/1994. It was developed using 
  Borland C++ 4 in the Win32s subsystem (hard times). Borland changed the OWL library and the code became 
not reusable. 
  So I give up and started to plan for a new version with other tools. But the opportunity never came, so I decided to 
  start a small system to help me implement and test some routines.</p>
<p><b>ImLab </b>was conceived during the course 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.visgraf.impa.br/Courses/ipcg.html">&quot;Image Processing for Computer Graphics&quot;</a> that I did in 1997.</p>
<p>It was updated for the course 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~scuri/inf1378">&quot;Processamento Digital de Imagens&quot;</a> 
  that I present in 2002. At the time the code was highly rearranged to facilitate 
  understanding. I also generated a page for the program and executables for several platforms.</p>
<p>In 2004, almost all the image processing code was moved to the
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im">IM</a> toolkit, building a major release version of that library, 
	with also several improvements for both IM and ImLab.</p>
<p>Since then it is being periodically updated and improved. Check the list of changes in 
<a href="history.html">History</a>. Also there is a list of <a href="to_do.html">To Do's</a>. What still makes 
<b>ImLab </b>an &quot;experimental&quot; system is 
  marked in color.</p>

<h2><a name="others">Other Systems</a></h2>
<p>There are other free systems like <b>ImLab</b>. It is hard to compare because 
<b>ImLab </b>is not fully 
  operational. It is interesting to note that there is only one portable system with free open source code equivalent to
  <b>ImLab</b>, but it is in Java. So <b>ImLab </b>is still a good option for C/C++ programmers.</p>

    NIH Image was one of the first free image processing system. Originally runs 
	only in old Macs. There are lots of variations from it, including a Windows 
    version. <strong>ImageJ</strong> was inspired in the NIH Image and it has been constantly updated 
	since then. Has a 
    very wide number of users, and innumerous features with several collections 
	of plugins.</p>
