<h2 class="style1">Quick Guide</h2>
<p>Here is a brief guide about <b>ImLab</b>. I also created a simple 
<a href="doxygen/index.html">internal 
  documentation&nbsp;</a> of headers to help the development of new functionalities. The documentation was created through 
  comments on the source code itself then running the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a> 
  tool. A Help system is missing, so another way to understand some operations is to look at the source code or send me 
  an e-mail.</p>
<p><b>ImLab</b> works with&nbsp;the IM&nbsp;image structure definition. The IM manual is very extensive and should be consulted, 
  see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im">http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/im</a>.</p>
<p>See the list of <b>ImLab</b> <a href="features.html">Features</a>.</p>
<h3>Main Window</h3>
<p>To mimic the Windows Multi Document Interface independent from platform and using IUP, 
<b>ImLab</b> has a main 
  window that starts &quot;maximized&quot;. From this window you can start all 
the operations. The image windows will be secondary windows that can be freely 
arranged. The main window also contains a log area where operations send textual information. </p>
<h3>Input/Output</h3>
<p>Files are loaded and saved by the IM library, so the file formats supported are directly related to the file 
  formats supported by the IM library. Files can be opened from the menus, from the command line and from drag and drop 
from 
  Windows Explorer or from Gnome Nautilus. Frames from multipaged files and video files are imported as independent images, this is not a 
  solution that I like, but is the solution for now. The file attributes are 
also available for simple editing.</p>
<p>When files are loaded or created a document is created that contains an image 
and a file format.</p>
<p>You can also copy and paste images from the clipboard in Windows and capture from Direct Show devices. 
It is possible to capture from two different sources at the same time but this 
is very hardware dependent.</p>
<h3>Views</h3>
<p>The CD library is used to print the image and to draw the image in a window canvas. Also it is used to import and 
  export some graphics files. </p>
<p>In order to visualize the many available types of images it is necessary to convert to a bitmap image. This 
  conversion is done automatically but can be controlled in the View menu. For example, images resulting from Fourier 
  transform are complex, standard visualization uses the magnitude of the complex number, but also could be the phase, 
  the real part or the imaginary part.&nbsp; In addition, to improve quantization it is possible to use a logarithmic 
  function to expand the contrast.</p>
<p>The secondary views of the same image document are updated when the image is 
changed. Also the Matrix view can change the image data and everything will be 
also updated. If you click in the image all the Matrix views will scroll to that 
position, and the pixel value will be copied to the log. Clicking in the 
Histogram will also copy its value to the log. When viewing the image in full 
screen pressing the arrow keys will cycle to the next image in the 
  list of the opened windows.</p>
<h3>Processing</h3>
<p>After processing an image, the new document title is changed to reflect the operation. If it gets to big you can 
  rename it from the menu. When the processing does not creates a new document the title is not changed. The new 
document 
  inherit the properties of the original one including file format and attributes. </p>
<p>When an operation requires more 
  than one image, the other images are listed in a dialog, the current image will appear selected.</p>
<p>Some processing functions can change the image type to improve the accuracy of the 
  results.</p>
<p>To add a menu item to the &quot;Process&quot; menu, edit one of the existent files at the &quot;src/process&quot; folder and observe 
  how the other items are implemented. To create a new submenu or an item directly in the&nbsp; &quot;Process&quot; menu, besides 
  having to create a file similar to the existing ones, you will edit the &quot;plugin_process.cpp&quot; file and add the new Plug-In 
  in the desired position.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>After analyzing an image to find regions you can measure those regions for a 
few parameters. The result of the measures is displayed in a sheet that can be 
saved in CSV (comma separated value) format that it is automatically recognized 
by Excel and other similar programs. This table can be edited.</p>
